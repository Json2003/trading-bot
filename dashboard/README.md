# Trading Bot Dashboard

This directory integrates multiple frontend clients and a backend server for interacting with the trading bot.

## Components

- **backend/** – Flask server that exposes API endpoints by reusing the trading bot's built-in dashboard.
- **electron-app/** – Desktop client implemented with Electron.
- **flutter_app/** – Mobile client implemented with Flutter.

Each component is a minimal starter intended to be expanded for full dashboard functionality.
